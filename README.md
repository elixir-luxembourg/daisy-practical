# Practical with the Data Information System (DAISY)


Data Information System (DAISY) is a data bookkeeping application designed to help biomedical research institutions with their GDPR accountability.
In this practical you'll use DAISY to record your research project and the human-subject data involved in your project.


## Required material

Before starting the practical, make sure you have the following ready, if not, please notify your session instructor.

* The URL link for the DAISY training instance.
* User credentials to login to the training instance.
* The [example scenario](https://github.com/elixir-luxembourg/DS-DM-training/blob/master/resources/DM-DP_RunningExample.pdf) of our workshop.

## Exercise 1: Record project

Record your research **project** as per example scenario. Pay attention to the following:

  * Document people related to the project:
      * The responsible persons for the project are your lab's PI, yourself and the PI of the sequencing platform.
      * Another postdoc from your lab is also working on the project (developing the pipeline), but he is not considered responsible for the human data.
      * You collaborator PI at the hospital is an (external) contact person, and needs to be documented as the provider of data/samples.    
  * Document that the ethics approval for your project is covered by a parent research programme.
  * You have a draft data management plan for your project, generated in the earlier session. You can upload your DMP as a project document.

## Exercise 2: Link project to its parent

There already exists a project definition in DAISY describing a research programme that encompasses several activities including your project. In this exercise, you're asked to:
 
  * Search for the (parent) project record in DAISY for this research programme (HINT: it is categorised as an "epidemiological study", has a "CNER approval" and runs until 2022). 
      * Make a note of the parent project's name.
      * Make a note of the other sub-project under the parent (you will need this info in Exercise 4).
  * Locate your own project, the one you created in Exercise 1.
  * Update your own project so that there is a structural link between your project and the parent/umbrella project.


## Exercise 3: Record dataset

Record the samples and the data generated from those samples by creating a **dataset** within your newly created project. Pay attention to the following:

  * The people responsible for the project are also the responsible for the dataset.
  * Record the details about data using **"data declaration(s)"**.
      * Record the source of your data, it is received from a collaborator i.e. the hospital.
      * Record what is received from collaborator and also what data is generated. 
      * Record the fact that data subjects are (healthy) controls.
      * Record a storage duration for the data, what would be a reasonable duration?  
      * Record the user restrictions on data. 
  * Record the GDPR legal basis for your processing of data.     
  * Record where you're storing the master and working copies of data. 


## Exercise 4: Record data access in and across projects

Record the data access policy you follow in your project. To do so:
  * Locate your dataset, the one you created in Exercise 3.
  * Document access policy for your dataset. Which categories of users have access to which locations within your project?
  * Assume you shared your data with other project(s) under the same research programme.  Document this fact.
